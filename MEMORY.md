# Project Memory

## Active Tasks

- None

## Completed Tasks

- Implement Feedback modal in Movie Viewer. Creates a new component to ping a Discord Webhook securely without routing the user offsite.

## Architectural Decisions

- UI leans heavily towards "glassmorphism" with `glass-panel` and standard `btn` classes.
- Playback relies on VidKing iframe and captures messages from it.
- Forms should retain the application's clean glassmorphic style.
